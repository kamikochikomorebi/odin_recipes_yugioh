    <h2>Overall Deck Building Basics</h2>
        <p>A <strong>Yu-Gi-Oh</strong> deck must have <em>at least</em> 40 cards but there is no upper limit. However, keeping closer to 40 of your absolute best cards gives you a higher chance of drawing an extremely powerful card. Be careful though, if a player is unable to draw a card from the deck at the beginning of their turn, <strong><em>that player automatically loses the duel.</em></strong> It is generally recommended for beginners to have a mix of about 20 monsters, 10 spells, and 10 traps but you can alter these amounts as you get a feel for the game. Control-oriented decks will typically include more traps for disruption, while combo-based decks may have more monsters and spells to execute their combinations. It's best to include a few of each of the different sub-types of traps, spells, and monsters in your deck and dueling a few times to see the pros and cons of each before altering the golden ration. With that in mind, visit each of the links below to learn more about the different types of traps, types of spell cards, and types of monsters.</p>

    <h2>The 6 Phases Of A Player's Turn</h2>
    <p>Sometimes cards will have effects that apply to a specific phase of a player's turn so it's important to know the proper order.</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Draw Phase:</strong> At the beginning of your turn, draw one card (unless another card activated explicitly says otherwise).</li>
        <li><strong>Standby Phase:</strong> Nothing naturally happens in the <strong>Standby Phase</strong> but it is common for phase-specific cards to take place during this phase.</li>
        <li><strong>Main Phase 1:</strong> You may summon up to 1 monster and as many magic (also called spell) cards and as many trap cards as you would like.</li>
        <li><strong>Battle Phase:</strong> This is when you can attack your opponents monsters on the field. Each of your monsters can only attack once per turn and it must happen during this phase. If your opponent has no monsters on the field, you can attack their Life Points directly.</li>
        <li><strong>Main Phase 2:</strong> This is the exact same as <strong>Main Phase 1</strong>. You might want to do things in <strong>Main Phase 2</strong> instead of <strong>Main Phase 1</strong> for strategic reasons. For example, if you think your opponent may have hidden a trap card called Mirror Force (which destroys all face up monsters on your opponent's side of the field and can be triggered when your opponent attacks) you might decide not to lay down a monster during <strong>Main Phase 1</strong> in fear of it being sent to the graveyard when you attack in the Battle Phase. Since you can only summon one monster per turn, waiting to summon a monster until after Mirror Force was played would prevent your opponent from attacking your life points directly on their next turn.</li>
        <li><strong>End Phase</strong> Just as with the Standby Phase, nothing happens during this phase unless explicitly stated on an active card.</li>
    </ol>
