    <h2>Overall Deck Building Basics</h2>
        <p>A Yu-Gi-Oh deck must have at least 40 cards but there is no upper limit. However, keeping closer to 40 of your absolute best cards gives you a higher chance of drawing an extremely powerful card. Be careful though, if a player is unable to draw a card from the deck at the beginning of their turn, that player automatically loses the duel. It is generally recommended for beginners to have a mix of about 20 monsters, 10 spells, and 10 traps but you can alter these amounts as you get a feel for the game. Control-oriented decks will typically include more traps for disruption, while combo-based decks may have more monsters and spells to execute their combinations. It's best to include a few of each of the different sub-types of traps, spells, and monsters in your deck and dueling a few times to see the pros and cons of each before altering the golden ration. With that in mind, visit each of the links below to learn more about the different types of traps, types of spell cards, and types of monsters.</p>
