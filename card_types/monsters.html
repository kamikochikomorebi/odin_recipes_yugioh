    <h2>Types Of Monster Cards</h2>
        <p>There are 4 types of monster cards: Normal, Effect, Ritual, and Fusion.</p>
        <p>A <strong>normal</strong> monster is the simplest type of monster in Yu-Gi-Oh. It has no special abilities or effects. These cards are typically represented with a yellow background and feature just basic stats: <strong>ATK</strong> (attack points) and <strong>DEF</strong> (defense points).</p>
        <p><strong>Effect</strong> monsters have special abilities or effects that can change the flow of the game. These effects can range from things like dealing damage, destroying cards, drawing cards, or even summoning other monsters. Effect Monsters are the most common type of monster in Yu-Gi-Oh. They have the same basic stats (ATK and DEF) but also have a text box explaining their effects.</p>
        <p>A <strong>ritual</strong> monster is a special type of monster that is summoned through a specific ritual. To summon a Ritual Monster, you need to use a Ritual Spell Card. The Ritual Spell Card will tell you how many monsters you need to tribute (sacrifice) in order to summon the Ritual Monster. These monsters are often very powerful, but the process to summon them is harder than normal monsters.</p>
        <p>A <strong>fusion</strong> monster is created by combining two or more monsters together using a spell card called "Polymerization". These cards, like ritual monsters, tend to be more powerful, but can be hard to get onto the field of play to begin with. These are also the only cards of any kind that do not go into your main deck of at least 40 cards. You instead place them in your "fusion deck" which usually only consists of one or two monsters and therefore do not count towards the number of cards in your main deck.</p>
