    <h2>Types of Trap Cards</h2>
    <p>There are types 3 of trap cards: normal traps, counter traps, and continuous traps.</p>
    <p>A <strong>normal</strong> trap card is a card that you set face-down on the field and then activate during your opponent's turn (or sometimes during your own). These cards are typically used to interrupt your opponent’s actions or to deal with specific situations, like negating a monster’s summon or destroying one of their cards. Once a Normal Trap is used, it’s sent to the Graveyard, meaning it’s only a one-time use.</p>
    <p>A <strong>counter</strong> trap card is a special type of Trap that can only be activated in response to another card’s effect. These are the most powerful Trap Cards because they can negate spells or traps played by your opponent, making them a great way to stop combos or powerful moves. Counter Traps always have the highest priority, meaning they’ll interrupt other effects, and they can’t be negated by most other cards.</p>
    <p>A <strong>continuous</strong> trap card is a Trap that stays on the field after it’s activated, unlike Normal Traps that are discarded. These cards have an ongoing effect that can last for as long as they remain on the field. Continuous Traps are useful for controlling the game in the long run, as they usually provide effects that last multiple turns. You can still activate them in response to things your opponent does, but they remain in play until they're destroyed or removed.</p>
