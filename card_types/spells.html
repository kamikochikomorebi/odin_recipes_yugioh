    <h2>Types of Spell Cards</h2>
        <p>There are 4 types of spell cards: quick-play, equip, field, and ritual.</p>
        <p>A <strong>quick-play</strong> spell card is a type of spell that can be activated during either player's turn, which is what makes it "quick." You can play it during your opponent’s turn in response to something they do. This makes Quick-Play Spell Cards super useful for reacting to situations, like negating effects or setting up combos. The main rule is that you can only activate them from your hand during your turn, but if you have it set face-down on the field, you can activate it on your opponent’s turn as well.</p>
        <p>An <strong>equip</strong> spell card is used to attach to a monster on the field, giving it an effect. Usually, Equip Spells increase the monster's Attack or Defense points, or sometimes grant the monster a special ability. However, they stay on the field attached to the monster until either the monster is destroyed or the Equip Spell is removed.</p>
        <p>A <strong>field</strong> spell card is a type of Spell that affects the entire playing field. When activated, it changes the rules of the game in a specific way—like changing the terrain, adding bonuses to certain types of monsters, or modifying the effects of certain cards. Field cards usually add <strong>ATK</strong> and <strong>DEF</strong> to all of both players monsters, but only if they are a specific attribute (such as Dark, Light, Earth, etc). You can only have one Field Spell active at a time and it stays in play until another card destroys it, so if you play a new one, it will replace the old one.</p>
        <p>A <strong>ritual</strong> spell card is used to summon a ritual monster from your hand or deck. You need to use the Ritual Spell in combination with other monsters you have on the field or in your hand as "tributes" to perform the Ritual Summon. Ritual Spells tell you exactly which monsters you need to sacrifice to summon the Ritual Monster, and they are essential for bringing out those special, powerful monsters.</p>
